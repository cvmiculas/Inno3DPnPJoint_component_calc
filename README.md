# Tube Components Initial Stiffness Calculator for Inno3DPnPJoint Element from OpenSees using Jupyter Notebook and Binder

## Intro
Welcome to the Inno3DPnPJoint_component_calc jupyter notebook's repository! This notebook was designed to facilitate the calculation of the initial stiffness of the tube compoenents (i.e., face and interaction components) of the Inno3DPnPJoint beam-to-column finite element implemented in OpenSees.

This notebook was created as part of the Ph.D. thesis titled "INNOVATIVE PLUG-AND-PLAY JOINTS FOR HYBRID TUBULAR CONSTRUCTIONS, authored by Cristian V. Miculaș (cristian.miculas@uc.pt), and supervised by Ricardo Joel Teixeira Costa (rjcosta@dec.uc.pt) and Luís Alberto Proença Simões da Silva (luisss@dec.uc.pt). The work was developed at the Institute for Sustainability and Innovation in Structural Engineering (www.isise.net), Coimbra Branch, within the University of Coimbra, Portugal (www.uc.pt).

The research leading to this notebook was made possible by funding from the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia) under grant agreement SFRH/BD/138151/2018 attributed to the author.

Thank you for using this notebook. We hope it will be helpful for your research. Also, feel free to submit changes and remember to cite the work.
